        I'm a passionate full-stack developer dedicated to crafting accessible
        and visually stunning user interfaces that seamlessly blend thoughtful
        design with robust engineering. My ideal projects lie at the
        intersection of design and development, creating experiences that are
        not only aesthetically pleasing but also meticulously built for optimal
        performance and usability.

        My skillset spans front-end, back-end, and mobile development. On the
        front-end, I'm proficient in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript,
        leveraging styling frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Styled Components to
        build modern and responsive interfaces. For the back-end, I utilize
        Node.js and NestJS to construct robust and scalable APIs. My mobile
        development experience is primarily with React Native. MongoDB is my
        preferred database solution for many projects. I hold a Graduation in
        Systems Analysis and Development and have one year of professional
        experience in the field.
